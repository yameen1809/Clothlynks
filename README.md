# Clothlynks
An online clothing store for people to explore and test it out. People can buy all kinds of clothes from there. It was made for practice. The payment is configured to test mode, hence no payment will be actually completed even though if it shows it is completed. Integrated with React, React Redux, and Firebase. The payment gateway was integrated with Stripe API. The contact page have not been built yet.
